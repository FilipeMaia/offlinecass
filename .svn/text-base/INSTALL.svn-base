Install instructions for CASS
=============================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software packages need to be installed and available for building and running CASS:
  - Qt version 4.x
  - ROOT version 5.24 or higher
  - LCLS package, available from http://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/Online+Analysis+And+Monitoring


Needed Environment Variables
----------------------------

LCLSSYSINCLUDE: needs to point to the root folder of LCLS Stuff that contains the pdsdata folder
LCLSSYSLIB: needs to point to the folder the build libraries are in.

ROOTSYS: needs to point where root is installed
QTDIR:   needs to point where Qt is installed
QTROOTSYSDIR: needs to point where root is installed (PLEASE NOTE root; i.e. it is usually set equal to ROOTSYSY)


To build root/QtRoot:
---------------------
  - install Qt
  - insert Qt-path in PATH env-variable
  - use INSTALL_QTROOT.sh (http://root.bnl.gov/QtRoot/INSTALL_QTROOT.sh) 
    to download/install root and qtROOT (remember to use ROOTSYS to install root to the preferred location).
    In principle you can download and install root by yourself without using the above quoted shell-script.
    It could be also worthy to read the script and "extract" only what it is needed, to be sure that every
    env-variable is set properly, otherwise the script will try to install everything from scratch!!
    The script is nicely written but not completely fail-proof, the best is to run it from an empty directory!!
  - At the moment I have excluded coin3d from the installation (not worthy for my purposes)

Building CASS
-------------

Use qmake with appropriate options to create Makefiles, i. e.,
  qmake -r
then run
  cre_dicts
  make
  sudo make install
to build and install the software.

Running CASS
------------
in order to run cass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be properly set

<tcsh>  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ROOTSYS/lib:$QTDIR/lib:$Dict_LIB/:$All_libs
<bash>  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$QTDIR/lib:$Dict_LIB/:$All_libs
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

the All_libs variable should point where the cass-so-libraries are stored (at the moment
they are distributed, each in a different directory cass_remi/cass_vmi ...)
in my case the following 3 variables are set before LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set:

setenv Dict_LIB /reg/neh/home/ncoppola/diode/trunk/cass_dictionaries
setenv MY_HOME /reg/neh/home/ncoppola/diode/trunk
setenv All_libs $MY_HOME/cass_machinedata:$MY_HOME/cass_pnccd:$MY_HOME/cass_remi:$MY_HOME/cass_vmi
